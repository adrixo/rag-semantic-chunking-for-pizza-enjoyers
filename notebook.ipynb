Although flatbread with toppings existed since ancient times, pizza as we know it developed when tomatoes arrived from America in the 16th century. Initially viewed with suspicion, poor Neapolitans began using them on flatbread, creating the first 'pizza al pomodoro.' Pizza truly gained popularity in 1889 when pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito created 'Pizza Margherita' for Queen Margherita of Savoy. From Naples, it spread throughout Italy and then worldwide thanks to Italian immigration.\",\n",
